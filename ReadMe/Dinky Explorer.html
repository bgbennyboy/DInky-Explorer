			By Bennyboy and Jan Frederick<br>
			Version 0.5.2<br>
			<a href="http://quickandeasysoftware.net">http://quickandeasysoftware.net</a></span><br><br>
		</span>
		
		<p class="style7"><strong><em>New in this version (0.5.2):</em></strong><br>
		<ul class="style7">
		<li>Bugfix release, there is a file in at least one version of Thimbleweed Park that is 0 bytes big. This caused a crash when dumping all files and is now fixed. This was  a regression from when the RTMI changes were added.</li>	
		</ul>
		
		<p class="style7"><strong><em>New in the previous version (0.5.1):</em></strong><br>
		<ul class="style7">
			<li>Bugfix release, audio couldnt be played because a dll didnt get packaged with the program. This is now fixed.</li>	
		</ul>
		
		<p class="style7"><strong><em>What is Dinky Explorer?:</em></strong><br>
		An explorer tool for the excellent games Return to Monkey Island, Thimbleweed Park and the Delores mini-adventure.<br>
		It does the following:
		
	<ul class="style7">
		<li>Lets you browse through the game's files and dump individual files/all files.</li>
		<li>Lets you play and dump the audio.</li>
		<li>Lets you view and save the images.</li>
		<li>Lets you view and save the scripts. Decompiling them if necessary.</li>
		<li>Lets you edit the functions in the Return to MI weird.dink script and create/apply patch files to modify it.</li>
		<li>Decodes and displays various other filetypes as you browse through the files.</li>
	</ul>		
		
	</p>

	

	<p class="style7"><em><strong>What versions are supported?:</strong></em><br> 
	The games are available for different platforms but its only been fully tested on the windows versions.<br>
	</p>
	

	<p class="style7"><em><strong>How to use it:</strong></em><br>
	<ul>
		<li class="style7">Click <i><u>Open</i></u> and browse to a game folder. Choose one of the resource files.<br>If the game is Return to Monkey Island the game will extract the decryption keys from the exe file. If it cant automatically find this file then it'll prompt you to browse and choose it.</li><br>
		<li class="style7">Click <i><u>Save File</i></u> to save a file. Different options will appear here depending on the type of file you've selected.</li><br>

		<li class="style7">Click <i><u>Save All Files</i></u> to save all files. Different options will be available here depending on the type of files available in the currently open resource file.</li><br>
	</ul>
		<p class="style7">Filtering the files:</p>

	<ul>
		<li class="style7">Click on the <i><u>View</i></u> button to show a list of all the different file types, selecting one of these changes the view so that only these file types are visible.</li><br>
		<li class="style7">To reset the view and show all files, click the button again and click <i><u>View All Files</i></u>.</li> 
	</ul>	
		<p class="style7">Searching the files:</p>
	<ul>

		<li class="style7">To search just type in the search box. Searching ignores any filter that you've used. I.e. the view will be reset to 'All Files'. The search looks in file names and is an 'instant search' - the search happens as you type.</li><br>
		<li class="style7">To reset the view either delete the text in the search box or click the View button and select View all files.</li><br>
	</ul>
